Significance:
Karadaiyan Nombu is performed in remembrance of the story of a couple known as 'Satyvaan and Savitri'. According to the legends, Savitri was a princess who with her utmost devotion towards her husband, Satyvaan, saved him from the clutches of death.

The oldest known version of the story of Savitri and Satyavan (Sanskrit: सावित्री Sāvitrī and सत्यवान् Satyavān) is found in Vana Parva ("The Book of the Forest") of the Mahabharata. The story occurs as multiple embedded narratives as told by sage Markandeya. When Yudhishthira asks Markandeya whether there has ever been a woman whose devotion matched Draupadi’s, Markandeya replies by relating this story.

The story reads:
Recently married Savitri, overhears sage Narada telling her father, that her husband Satyavaan is destined to die in a year. Savitri is astonished to hear this and vows to not let this happen. When the God of Death (Yama) arrives to take Satyvaan's soul, Savitri pleads with him. She wins over Yama with her devotion and sincere speech about Dharma. Yama praises both the content and style of her words and offers any boon, except the life of Satyavan. Savitri asks Yama for restoration of their kingdom and a hundred children for herself and Satyvaan. The second wish creates a dilemma for Yama, as it would indirectly grant the life of Satyavaan. However, impressed by Savitri's dedication and purity, Yama grants life to Satyavaan and blesses Savitri's life with eternal happiness.

To celebrate Savitri's devoted love towards her husband, women prepare a special meal and pray for the long lives of their husbands. The word ‘Karadai’ refers to ‘a special naivedya (holy dish) and ‘nombu’ signifies ‘upvasam or vratam’.
